#### The Jittered Test

The original data were “jittered” multiple times by adding small amounts of random noise to their values. This was done twenty times and, for each version of the data, the same two models were fit to the jittered data. The fitted curves are shown in Figure 1.6. The moving average shows a significant degree of noise in the regression predictions but, on average, manages to track the data patterns well. The quadratic model was not confused by the extra noise and generated very similar (although inaccurate) model fits. (Feature Engineering and Selection - Kuhn and Johnson, 2020)
