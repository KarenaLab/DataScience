### DataScience
-----

A toolbox for a Data Science, most of tools are **tailormade** for my needs and works with other scripts.
The good point that these tools shows how the magic happens, on the other hand, maybe these tools will need an adjust for your needs.

Sometimes, or most of times, people ask me why a tailormade tool if *scikit-learn* or *scipy* (for example) do it **better** and **faster**.
Respectfully I do not agree with **better**; these tools exists and are developed because I want have the control of the flow, have access for some specific point of the pipeline or just keep recorded the sequence of some part of the pipeline that functions from libraries does not allow/give.
However I need to say that most of all pre-made tools from other libraries will do it **faster**. but... who said these tailormade tools will be going to production? These tools does not aims to go for production, at production I recommend to use functions from libraries and create a pipeline, these tools are specific for modeling, tunning, exploring or studying phase of the project.

If you wish to see these tools working and its advantages, take a look at [projects](https://github.com/KarenaLab/Projects) and [experiments](https://github.com/KarenaLab/Experiments).
