### Objectives of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) serves several critical objectives:

1. **Understanding the Dataset**:
   - Get acquainted with the structure, features, and overall characteristics of the dataset.
   - Actions include:
     - Checking columns and their data types (numerical, categorical, etc.).
     - Observing the dataset's dimensions (rows and columns).
     - Spotting initial issues, such as missing or extreme values.

2. **Identifying Patterns and Trends**:
   - Uncover meaningful insights through visualizations and statistics:
     - Use histograms or density plots for variable distributions.
     - Analyze trends over time using line graphs.
     - Group data to detect patterns (e.g., customers' spending habits by age).

3. **Detecting Anomalies**:
   - Spot outliers or missing values that might affect accuracy:
     - Box plots for outliers.
     - Scatter plots for unusual patterns.
     - Find and handle null or strange values (e.g., negative ages).

4. **Generating Hypotheses**:
   - Explore relationships and formulate hypotheses for deeper investigation:
     - Example: Does a higher advertising budget correlate with increased sales?
     - Tools: Scatter plots, heatmaps, pivot tables.

5. **Validating Assumptions**:
   - Ensure assumptions align with the data:
     - Check for normality in distributions (e.g., using Q-Q plots or histograms).
     - Assess variable independence if necessary.
     - Confirm the dataset meets requirements for modeling (e.g., no multicollinearity).

6. **Guiding Data Transformation**:
   - Preprocessing steps revealed by EDA:
     - Handle missing values (impute, remove, or flag).
     - Normalize or standardize variables.
     - Create new features (e.g., generating "Age" from "Date of Birth").
     - Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding).


#### EDA Techniques with Examples

1. **Descriptive Statistics**
- Use measures like **mean**, **median**, and **standard deviation** to understand the central tendency and spread of data.
  - **Example**: In a dataset of studentsâ€™ test scores, calculate the average score, find the minimum and maximum scores, and determine the variability across the class,

2. **Univariate Analysis**
- Analyze the distribution of a single variable:
  - **Histograms**: Show how the values of a numerical variable are distributed (e.g., the age distribution of customers),
  - **Box Plots**: Visualize the spread and detect outliers (e.g., salary distribution among employees),

3. **Bivariate Analysis**
- Explore relationships between two variables:
  - **Scatter Plots**: Investigate correlations (e.g., does marketing expenditure relate to sales revenue?),
  - **Bar Charts**: Compare groups (e.g., sales performance of different product categories),
  - **Line Charts**: Observe trends over time (e.g., temperature variation across months),

4. **Multivariate Analysis**
- Examine patterns involving three or more variables:
  - **Pairplot**: Visualize pairwise relationships in multi-dimensional datasets (e.g., relationships between age, income, and spending habits),
  - **Clustering**: Group data into segments (e.g., customer clusters based on behavior like frequency of purchases and spending amount),
  - **3D Scatter Plots**: To analyze three variables together (e.g., analyzing population growth, GDP, and literacy rate of countries),

5. **Heatmaps**
- Visualize correlations between variables in a dataset.
  - **Example**: In a real estate dataset, a heatmap can show that **square footage** and **price** have a strong positive correlation, whereas **distance from the city center** and **price** may have a negative correlation,

6. **Outlier Detection**
- Detect anomalies to assess data quality:
  - **Box Plots**: Highlight unusually high or low values (e.g., extremely high test scores in a dataset of student grades),
  - **Z-Score**: Quantify how far a data point is from the mean (e.g., identifying abnormally high electricity bills),

7. **Missing Value Analysis**
- Handle missing data:
  - Identify patterns in missing values (e.g., missing age entries in a survey dataset),
  - Decide how to deal with them: Imputation (e.g., replacing missing values with the mean or median) or exclusion,

8. **Feature Engineering**
- Create new meaningful variables:
  - **Example**: If you have `Date of Purchase`, create a new feature called `Days Since Last Purchase` to understand customer loyalty,
  - Convert categorical variables into numerical ones using **one-hot encoding** (e.g., convert "Male"/"Female" into separate binary columns),

9. **Time Series Analysis**
- Explore temporal data:
  - Use line plots to track trends (e.g., monthly stock prices over a year),
  - Check for seasonality (e.g., sales spikes during holiday seasons),
